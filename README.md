## 🧠 Project Overview

This project analyzes an **e-commerce dataset** to extract meaningful **business insights** using **SQL**.  
A **SQLite database** was created, and all analysis was performed using optimized SQL queries.

The goal is to demonstrate **real-world data analyst skills**, including:
- Data exploration
- Business metric calculation
- Data quality validation
- Analytical thinking

## 🗂️ Database Schema

**Tables used:**
- `customers`
- `orders`
- `order_items`
- `products`

**Relationships:**
customers → orders → order_items → products


---

## 📊 Key Business Questions Answered

- How many customers and orders exist?
- What are the most popular product categories?
- Which states generate the highest revenue?
- How does revenue change month over month?
- Who are the top 10 customers by spending?
- What is the average order value?
- How efficient is the delivery process?
- How much cost is spent on logistics (freight)?

---

## 🔍 Key Insights

- Revenue is calculated **only from delivered orders** to ensure accuracy  
- A small group of customers contributes a large portion of total revenue  
- Certain states consistently outperform others in sales  
- Some orders are delivered later than the estimated delivery date  
- Freight costs form a significant operational expense  

---

## ✅ Data Quality Checks

The following checks were performed before analysis:

- ✔ Verified uniqueness of `order_id`
- ✔ Checked NULL values in order lifecycle timestamps
- ✔ Validated price and freight values
- ✔ Identified orphan order items without matching orders
